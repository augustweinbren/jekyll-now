# Air Cycle, a Bicycle-Mounted Air Pollution Sensor and Monitor

Note: the codebase can be found in [the Air Cycle GitHub Repository](https://github.com/augustweinbren/air-cycle).

## Introduction

Outdoor air pollution, specifically particulate matter (PM), was responsible for 4.2 million deaths globally in 2016 (World Health Organization, 2016). London in particular is frequently found to exceed the PM 2.5 (particulates of diameter 2.5 micrometers or smaller) limits set by the World Health Organization (IQAir, 2021). However, particulate matter concentrations vary significantly between streets (LondonAir, 2021). As data from the London Air Quality Network does not include measurements on smaller streets (which comprise the bulk of my cycle commute), it is difficult to use existing data to quantify the particulate matter I am exposed to while bicycling to UCL on a daily basis.

In order to resolve this data gap, I have built a device that measures PM 1.0, PM 2.5 and PM 10.0. It visualises the PM 2.5 data on the device itself and offloads data using Bluetooth Low Energy to a free IoT cloud service, Adafruit IO, via a connected smartphone. It also mounts securely on bicycle handlebars while allowing for regular dismounting to prevent theft and damage. 

## Documentation

The development is broken up into a series of increasingly complex iterations to ease debugging and allow others to better understand the code.

### Prerequisites

Please refer to the following sections in the GitHub README for prerequisites
- [Items needed](https://github.com/augustweinbren/air-cycle#items-needed-)
- [Software installation guide](https://github.com/augustweinbren/air-cycle#installations-and-software-setups-)

### (Optional) Arduino UNO Wifi Rev 2-based PM Sensor

It is recommended to start with `pm25Bluetooth`, which utilises an Arduino UNO Wifi Rev 2 microcontroller; the BLE interface is slightly simpler compared with that of the ESP32. Please see the [pm25Bluetooth directory](https://github.com/augustweinbren/air-cycle/tree/master/pm25Bluetooth) for further instructions. 

The following code snippet shows how BLE can be initialised:
```
BLEService pmService("c867682e-d8aa-4bf3-ba43-aa2ed0a24abf");
BLEByteCharacteristic pm10Characteristic(
  "d5212717-dd8e-4710-a332-ab35a282ba7c", BLERead | BLENotify);
BLEByteCharacteristic pm25Characteristic(
  "486c7b93-7fd5-43cc-8a17-b32a6cf4d8ab", BLERead | BLENotify);
BLEByteCharacteristic pm100Characteristic(
  "6f440878-5a1a-4a76-819a-3e64f73098dd", BLERead | BLENotify);
```
The keys need to be randomly generated to prevent two nearby Bluetooth devices from having the same keys. The `BLERead` attribute makes each of the characteristics viewable from a smartphone via LightBlue, and `BLENotify`, by notifying the connected smartphone when new data has come in, will allow the smartphone to send all of the PM data to an auxiliary server (in the case of this project Adafruit IO). Most of the remaining BLE code differs significantly from the ESP32 used in the final prototype, so I will not cover it in further detail.

The ArduinoBLE example [ButtonLED](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE/blob/master/examples/Peripheral/ButtonLED/ButtonLED.ino) was referred to in the writing of this code, along with the [PM2.5 Air Quality Sensor documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/pm25-air-quality-sensor/arduino-code).

### Blink on the ESP32

This code will test that your ESP32 works properly.

The code for the ESP32 Blink example can be found in the [Blink_ESP32 directory](https://github.com/augustweinbren/air-cycle/tree/master/Blink_ESP32). It is a copy of [code written by Aswinth Raj (2018)](https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/getting-started-with-esp32-with-arduino-ide).

Note that when uploading code to an ESP32, you must hold down the "BOOT" button as it is uploading.

### Visualising PM on the ESP32 using an Adafruit NeoPixel

This example will require prototyping the final circuitry layout for this project.

It involves using an Adafruit NeoPixel LED strip to visualise air quality, with the colour of pixels corresponding to the common style used in the Air Quality Index:

![AQI color code]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/02_air_cycle/AQI.png "Air Quality Index standard colours")

Within each Air Quality Index level, more pixels will correspond to worse air quality. This design was inspired by [SODAQ AIR (2021)](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/olliesmeenk/sodaq-air-the-portable-air-quality-monitor):

![SODAQ Air sensor prototype]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/02_air_cycle/sodaq_air.png "SODAQ Air device using a single strip of LEDs to represent the AQI")

Instructions with schematics for this step are available in the [pm25_neopixel_esp32 directory](https://github.com/augustweinbren/air-cycle/tree/master/pm25_neopixel_esp32). Much of the PM 2.5-specific code was adapted from the previously-mentioned guide published on [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/pm25-air-quality-sensor/arduino-code).

### Designing an enclosure for the device

Please refer to the [enclosure section of Air Cycle's main README](https://github.com/augustweinbren/air-cycle#enclosure-) for guidelines. 

The size of the device (specifically the power bank) meant that a large enclosure was needed. 

![Air Cycle deployed on bicycle]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/02_air_cycle/air-cycle-in-wild.png "Air Cycle device on a test ride, showing the present AQI conditions")

The large enclosure required a large mount which needed to be attached at three different support points along the stem and handlebars of the bicycle.

![Image of handlebars showing relative locations of stem and handlebar attachment points]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/02_air_cycle/handlebar-reference.png "The handlebars used for mounting the Air Cycle")

Thus, the prints will invariably require adjustments by the end user to ensure that the mount fits their bicycle stem and handlebars closely.

### (Optional) Logging runtime using the ESP32 EEPROM memory
[pm25_neopixel_esp32_eeprom](https://github.com/augustweinbren/air-cycle/tree/master/pm25_neopixel_esp32_eeprom) adds in time-logging: by writing to the EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read only memory). As this memory is non-volatile, its data will be conserved between power outages. My intention was in particular to use it to test out the battery life of the device. 

The following code segments are most relevant:

```
  days = EEPROM.read(0);
  hours = EEPROM.read(1);
  tenMinuteInts = EEPROM.read(2);
  minutes = tenMinuteInts * 10;
  EEPROM.write(0, 0);
  EEPROM.write(1, 0);
  EEPROM.write(2, 0);
```
In this code block which occurs during setup, EEPROM's first three slots of memory are read out into three different variables with `EEPROM.read()`, and then the three memory slots are all reset to 0 with `EEPROM.write()`. Ten minute intervals are stored instead of one minute intervals because the number of lifetime read and write operations on the EEPROM is limited.

### Integrating BLE into the ESP32 device
The final Arduino software version deployed was [pm25_neopixel_esp32_bt_eeprom](https://github.com/augustweinbren/air-cycle/blob/master/pm25_neopixel_esp32_bt_eeprom/pm25_neopixel_esp32_bt_eeprom.ino)

The BLE code was significantly more complex in this iteration than in the first iteration. Callbacks, which dictate behaviours to execute on the connection and disconnection of a device, were created:

```
class MyServerCallbacks: public BLEServerCallbacks {
    void onConnect(BLEServer* pServer) {
      deviceConnected = true;
    };

    void onDisconnect(BLEServer* pServer) {
      deviceConnected = false;
    }
};
```
In particular, these callbacks were used to start advertising after a peripheral (in this case the smartphone) disconnected:
```
  if (!deviceConnected && oldDeviceConnected) {
    Serial.println("Client disconnected");
    delay(500);
    pServer->startAdvertising();
    Serial.println("Advertising again");
    oldDeviceConnected = false;
  }

  if (deviceConnected && !oldDeviceConnected) {
    Serial.println("Client connected");
    oldDeviceConnected = true;
  }
```
With this logic, disconnection events could be identified and advertising the data could be started again soon afterwards.

### No-Code integrations: storing visualising data on a web server using LightBlue and AdaFruit IO

After the final example is uploaded to the ESP32 microcontroller, data can be readily uploaded to Adafruit IO for cloud storage and a variety of visualisations. PunchThrough, the creators of LightBlue, have created some [in-depth documentation on this topic](https://punchthrough.com/setting-up-adafruit-io-with-lightblue-cloud-connect/). Additionally, [a GPS logger](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/mytracks-the-gps-logger/id358697908) should be started before running LightBlue to continuously store geographic location for later coupling with the Particulate Matter measurements.

## Reflection

There are three different components of this project that remain a work in progress: the hardware circuitry, the enclosure, and the software. 

To start with the hardware, the ESP32-based device is able to consistently collect particulate matter measurements and instantaneously visualise them using a NeoPixel strip. However, the measurements, although correlated with  high traffic conditions are highly negatively biased: measurements are much lower than the true values, with a recent commute showing a peak PM 2.5 Air Quality Index of 15. 

![Adafruit IO Data Feed]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/02_air_cycle/adafruitIOFeeds.png "Adafruit IO Data Feed shows the data captured by the phone over BLE via LightBlue over the course of a test ride")

For comparison, at the time of writing of this blog post, the minimum PM 2.5 AQI in the past 48 hours was 46 for PM 2.5 (World Air Quality Index, 2022). Thus, it is clear the PMS5003 PM sensor needs to be calibrated. Of additional note is the energy requirements of the device: Dhruv Kumar remarked on the energy intensity of Adafruit Neopixels. Thus, it would make sense to switch out the neopixel for ordinary RGB LEDs, which would still enable the current visualisation style while potentially reducing the power consumption. Additionally size of the device could be reduced by incorporating a boost converter that can shift from 3V to 5V; this would allow the power bank to be replaced with a rechargable battery-pack charger, which maintains a much slimmer profile.

Smaller circuitry could lead to a more elegant enclosure. Specifically, a slimmer profile could allow for a thicker case to be less obtrusive, thus increasing the water resistance. It would also be imperative to innovate on the mount to make it more bicycle-neutral, so that more types of bicycles could use identical mounts. Lastly, more elegant clasp systems are needed: both to prevent the device from falling off of the bicycle and for preventing the hardware from falling out when the body is removed, upside-dowm, from the base. 

With regards to the software, the key changes that require the most attention are those that deal with user interaction: the current method of requiring a user to manually open both a GPS logger and LightBlue, before later coupling the data manually is not user friendly. Therefore, my current plan for the next step in this project is to develop a Flutter app similar to the Android-exclusive app developed by [CanAirIO](https://github.com/kike-canaries/canairio_android). This would entail creating an app that automatically stores GPS-tagged PM measurements to a server after connecting to the device via Bluetooth. Ideally, the data could both be shared with other people who are also collecting Particulate Matter data via their bicycles, and perhaps, eventually, the data could be integrated with that of London Air Quality Network to create a higher-resolution map of London's air quality.
