MSc Student in Connected Environments within UCL's Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis.

Previously, I worked as a scientific software engineer at the UK Met Office, where I developed C++ based infrastructure for performant observation processing and data assimilation.

I graduated from Johns Hopkins in 2019, where I studied Environmental Engineering and Applied Mathematics & Statistics.
